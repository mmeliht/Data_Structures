# File Hierarchy In C++ : 

### File hieararchy in c++ consists of 5 parts. Theese are "bin , include , lib , src , makefile " files.

## 1.Bin file consists executable files. 

## 1.1 What is executable files?
### Executable files contain binary machine code that has been compiled from source code. This low-level code instructs a computer's central processing unit on how to run a program. The processor interprets the machine code and tells the computer's hardware what to do.

## 2. Include file consists header files.

## 2.1 What is header files?
### These are those files that store predefined functions. It contains definitions of functions that you can include or import using a preprocessor directive #include. This preprocessor directive tells the compiler that the header file needs to be processed prior to the compilation.

## 3. Lib file consists library files and object files.

## 3.1 what is library and object files ?
### C++ object file is an intermediate file produced by a C++ compiler from a C++ implementation file and the C++ header files that the implementation file includes. The C++ linker produces the output executable or library of your project from your C++ object files.

## 4. Src file consists source code files. 


### Briefly, the C++ file structure and content are as follows.
